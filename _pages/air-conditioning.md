What is often not considered, or can be greatly underestimated, is the difference air conditioning makes to your daily comfort and health.

Air conditioners employ the same operating principles and basic components as the fridge you use in your kitchen. Fridges use energy (usually electricity) to transfer heat from the cool interior of the fridge to the relatively warm surroundings of your home. Likewise, an air conditioner uses energy to transfer heat from the interior of your home to the relatively warm outside environment.
